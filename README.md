- `function` is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
you can create function by 'def':
```python
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
```
- to make function return a value :
```python
  return value
```

--> ex03
- `None` represents the absence of a value and is the only instance of the NoneType.
It's often used as a placeholder for variables that don't hold meaningful data yet.
Unlike 0, "", or [], which are actual values, `None` specifically means "`no value`" or "`nothing`."

--> ex04
- `sys.argv` function lets you take argments from command line.
- `int()` for casting to intger.
- `try` : block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- `except` : block lets you handling error if occured.
- Since the try block raises an error, the except block will be executed.
Without the try block, the program will crash and raise an error
